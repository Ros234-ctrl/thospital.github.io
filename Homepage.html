          <p>  
               We are institutions that deal with health care activities. 
               They offer treatment to patients with specialized staff and equipment.
                In other words, hospitals serve humanity and play a vital role in the social welfare of any society.
                 They have all the facilities to deal with varying diseases to make the patient healthy.
                  The essay on hospital will take us through their types and importance.

          <p> A teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to health science students and auxiliary healthcare students.
                A health science facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic. 
                Hospitals have a range of departments (e.g. surgery and urgent care) and specialist units such as cardiology.
                 Some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units. Common support units include a pharmacy, pathology, and radiology.

          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>Currently, hospitals are largely staffed by professional physicians, surgeons, nurses, and allied health practitioners, whereas in the past, this work was usually performed by the members of founding religious orders or by volunteers. 
               
          However, there are various Catholic religious orders, such as the Alexians and the Bon Secours Sisters that still focus on hospital ministry in the late 1990s, as well as several other Christian denominations, including the Methodists and Lutherans, which run hospitals.[5] In accordance with the original meaning of the word, hospitals were original "places of hospitality", and this meaning is still preserved in the names of some institutions such as the Royal Hospital Chelsea, established in 1681 as a retirement and nursing home for veteran soldiers.

                         Patients and families know quality care when they experience it. A nurse's response time, a doctor's bedside manner, the hospital's atmosphereâ€”all of these things affect how people feel about the quality of their healthcare.
                         When hospitals talk about quality, it is generally in reference to very specific clinical data collected and analyzed over a period of time. Quality measurement isn't always easy. Different agencies and groups have different ways of reporting clinical outcomes that can affect the way they rate a hospital on a certain quality measure. Reporting systems can also be cumbersome or costly, making ratings even more difficult to produce. 
                         Today, there are limits to the numbers of conditions, treatments, and procedures that are reported and monitored, but as data systems and methods improve, more and more information will be available.
                         Quality data show how well a department or institution achieves desired health outcomes for a particular procedure, often by tracking how closely clinical staff meet standards of care.

                         Stanford Health Care is committed to providing clear, accurate and honest information about the quality of care we offer to all of our patients.
                          The quality data included here is the next step in an ongoing effort to increase the level of transparency around quality data so that our patients can make informed health care decisions.
